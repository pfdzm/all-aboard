# AllAboard

AllAboard is a simple student onboarding platform with three main use cases.

As an _admissions professional_ I want to have a platform where I can post information that is important to incoming students. I want to create and maintain pages with simple Markdown formatting. I want to be able to link from one page to another, as well as let students have a discussion thread about the relevant topic.

As a _student_ I want to see important information about applying for a visa, relocating to Berlin, finding an appartment on one simple to use page. I want to be able to ask questions about each topic as well as meet other incoming students.
